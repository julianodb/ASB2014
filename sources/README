file: README		G. Moody		3 December 2013

The code in this directory is provided as part of a sample entry for the
PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2014.  It comes from the WFDB Software Package
(see http://physionet.org/physiotools/wfdb.shtml), and it requires the
WFDB library (included in that package).

Although this sample entry conforms to the rules of the Challenge, a successful
entry will need to do more;  in particular, this code does not attempt to
analyse non-ECG signals (which will be useful when the ECG is absent or of poor
quality) and (as used in this sample entry) only one ECG signal is analyzed.

The file 'gqrs.conf' is not used in this sample entry.  If you wish to use
it, change '../next.sh' so that the command
   ./gqrs -r $1
becomes
   ./gqrs -r $1 -c gqrs.conf
Doing so will change the behavior of gqrs only if you modify gqrs.conf;  its
current contents reflect gqrs's default settings.
